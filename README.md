# HomeMade-Focuser

HomeMade.Focuser is a PHP+Python based focuser driver for Raspberry Pi+stepper motor focuser.

## Hardware

The hardware is based on a Raspberry pi (any version) running a webserver. The webserver rune a PHP script that handles communication and controls the stepper motor through a python script and GPIO.

## Software

The driver supports both absolute and relative positioning. Communication is done through the URL parameters and the reply is a standard json packet (needed for the ip-focuser INDI driver).

The last position of the focuser is persistent so no need to do anything at the start of every session. Just continue where you left off.
